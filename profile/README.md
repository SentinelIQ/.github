### 🔗 Integrated Workflow Architecture

The SentinelIQ platform components integrate seamlessly to provide a continuous threat intelligence lifecycle:

1. **Data Collection & Leak Detection**
   - SentinelFlow and SentinelLeak harvest and normalize internal logs, external feeds, paste sites, and dark web sources.
2. **Enrichment & Analysis**
   - SentinelAnalyze enriches and correlates indicators of compromise (IOCs) through automated enrichment pipelines.
3. **Predictive Modeling**
   - SentinelCore applies machine learning to detect anomalies, forecast threats, and prioritize risk.
4. **Orchestration & Automation**
   - AutoSentinel executes playbooks for credential rotation, URL blocking, ticketing, and remediation.
5. **Incident Management & Response**
   - SentinelResponse centralizes case management, threat sharing (via MISP), and audit-ready compliance reporting.
